## Usage

Be sure to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed before proceeding.

# Install dependencies
npm i

# Compile Sass
npm run css-compile

# Watch Sass for changes (uses nodemon)
npm run watch

# Start local server (uses sirv-cli)
npm run server

# Watches Sass for changes and starts a local server
npm start
```

For the most straightforward development, open two Terminal tabs to execute `npm run server` and `npm run watch` at the same time.

Open <http://localhost:3000> to see the page in action.
